## Game Developer

Hi, I'm Rob, a 35-year-old guy (he/him) living in Newcastle, WA who likes reverse-engineering, interpreters, and modding, and have worked professionally on popular game titles like Kerbal Space Program and From the Depths. I am currently working on [ChilloutVR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/661130/ChilloutVR/) with Alpha Blend Interactive.

Here you can find some of my open-source projects, although I am slowly migrating to [my gitlab account](https://gitlab.com/N3X15), since they support more features.

## Current Projects

 * [pyCSBinaryWriter](https://gitlab.com/N3X15/pycsbinarywriter) @ GitLab.com - API for interacting with .NET-generated binary structures in Python
 * [BuildTools](https://gitlab.com/N3X15/python-build-tools) @ GitLab.com - My own shoddy toolbag, includes custom dependency-resolving buildchain inspired by Tup.

I also work on a bunch of other projects using alts.

## Continued Learning

I am currently learning:

 * Rust (computer language)
 * Lark (lexing/parsing framework for Python)
 * Crafting interpreters from scratch
